Invocation
==========

The build utility is a front-end to various different build systems. It works
by examining the contents of the current directory (or some other directory
or file, if one is specified) and picking an appropriate handler based upon
a guess as to what kind of build system your project uses. For example,
if an .xcodeproj bundle is found, the "xcodebuild" handler will be used.

The actual work of building is split into "phases", summarised in the
usage information above. Not all of the handlers implement all of the
phases, and the precise meaning of a phase might vary slightly from
build system to build system.

The default build phase is "build", which maps to whatever you'd ordinarily
expect a build system to do when you ask it to build something. If you don't
specify --only (-O), then the "prepare" and "config" phases will be executed
first. Whether these two phases actually do anything depends upon the handler
in use.

So, at its simplest, you can run:

$ build

If you specify --dir (-C), build will switch to the specified directory before
doing anything else. If you also specify --project (-p), and it names a
relative path, that path must be relative to the directory specified by --dir,
rather than the current directory (this is consistent with GNU Make's
handling of its -C and -f options).

The -D option lets you define variables. These variables are merely stored
and passed on to the underlying build system in different ways. Some of the
handlers recognise particular variables and pass them onto the underlying
build system in special ways.

$ build -DFOO

Defines a variable named "FOO" with a value of "1". Variables can have specific
values:

$ build -DFOO=off

As well as -D, you can specify variables (provided that they have explicit
values) by placing them at the end of the command-line:

$ build config FOO=bar

(This executes the "config" build phase for the project in the current
directory, defining the variable "FOO" to be "bar").

There is no variable substitution by build itself. That is, this will
only do what you want if the underlying build system knows how to:

$ build config 'FOO=bar' 'BAZ=$FOO'

Many build systems *do* perform variable substitution themselves, so this
may indeed work, but you should be wary of syntax -- consider using the
substitution syntax which works across both sh(1) and make(1):

$ build config 'FOO=bar' 'BAZ=${FOO}'

Note also that single-quotes are used, to prevent the shell from substituting
itself.

The following variable names are also recognised as long options. That is,
you can specify --NAME or --NAME=VALUE instead of -DNAME[=VALUE]:

  prefix  exec-prefix  bindir  sbindir  libexecdir  sysconfdir  sharedstatedir
  localstatedir  libdir  includedir  oldincludedir  datarootdir  datadir
  infodir  localedir  mandir  docdir  htmldir  dvidir  pdfdir  psdir
  program-prefix program-suffix program-transform-name

(If you are familiar with GNU autoconf, you will recognise these names as
the standard options available in a 'configure' script).

In addition to the above, any long option starting "with-", "without-",
"enable-" or "disable-" will similarly define a variable with a matching name.

Given the above, here's an example of building an autoconf-based project, with
a separate object directory and installing to a staging root:

(The project is in 'sources' relative to the current directory)

$ mkdir obj
$ build -C obj --project=../sources --prefix=/opt/packages --sysconfdir=/etc install DESTDIR=/tmp/pkgroot

Handlers
========

1. xcodebuild

The 'xcodebuild' handler is responsible for building Xcode projects using
Apple's xcodebuild(1) utility:

		http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/xcodebuild.1.html

The path specified by --project must either be an .xcodeproj bundle directory,
or a directory containing exactly one .xcodeproj bundle. If no path is specified,
the current directory is searched instead.

Any variables are passed directly to xcodebuild.

The --product option is passed to xcodebuild as -target.

The --sdk option is passed to xcodebuild as -sdk.

The --config option is passed to xcodebuild as -configuration.

The --build, --host, and --target options are not supported.

The 'prepare', 'config' and 'distclean' phases are no-ops.

The 'clean', 'build' and 'install' phases invoke the equivalent
xcodebuild phases.

The BUILD_XCODEBUILD or XCODEBUILD environment variables may be used
to specify the path to xcodebuild, with the former variable overriding
the latter.

2. gnumake

The 'gnumake' handler is responsible for building Makefile-based
projects with GNU Make.

The 'prepare', 'config' and 'distclean' phases are no-ops.

Any variables defined are passed directly to make on the command-line;
any dashes are transformed to underscores.

The --build, --host, and --target options are transformed into variables
named BUILD_SYSTEM, HOST_SYSTEM and TARGET_SYSTEM respectively.

The handler will look for, in order of preference, a utility
in the PATH named "gnumake", "gmake" or "make". The BUILD_MAKE
or MAKE environment variables may be used to specify the path
to GNU Make, with the former variable overriding the latter.

The 'build', 'install' and 'clean' phases all invoke make,
specifying the name of the makefile via the '-f' make option.

The 'build' phase builds the default target of the project
makefile, except where the --product option is used. In this
event the value of this option is used as the name of the
target that make should build.

For example, invoking:

$ build --product=docs

...will result in a make command-line along the lines of:

gmake -f GNUmakefile docs

(assuming in this instance that 'GNUmakefile' exists in the project directory).

3. autoconf

The 'autoconf' handler builds GNU autotools-based projects. Such projects
are detected by the presence of a 'configure.ac' or 'configure.in' file
in either the project directory or one of its parents.

The 'prepare' phase invokes autoreconf(1) to generate a configure script.
If the 'prepare' phase is invoked implicitly as a prerequisite for the 'config'
phase, autoreconf(1) invocation will be skipped if either 'configure.gnu'
or 'configure' exists and has a modification time more recent than that
of 'configure.ac' or 'configure.in' (depending upon which exists, the
former taking precedence). If the 'prepare' phase is invoked explicitly,
autoreconf(1) is executed unconditionally.

autoreconf(1) is invoked with the '--install' option. The path to autoreconf
can be overridden by way of the BUILD_AUTORECONF or AUTORECONF environment
variables, with the former taking precedence.

The 'config' phase executes the project's 'configure.gnu' or 'configure'
script (the former taking precedence). Any of variables whose names
are listed as being acceptable as long options in the "Invocation" section
above are passed as parameters to the configure script, including those
beginning with "with-", "without-", "enable-" and "disable-". In addition,
any values specified with the --build, --host and --target options are
passed to the configure script.

The following variables are passed on the configure command-line following
any options:

  CPP  CPPFLAGS  CC  CFLAGS  LIBS  LDFLAGS

The 'build' phase invokes one of 'gnumake', 'gmake', or 'make', whichever
is found first. If a product is specified, it will be passed to make as
the name of the target to build.

Note that the detection logic for the autoconf handler
searches parent directories of the project directory in order to locate
the configure script, and so the project directory may be a subdirectory
of the project root -- in this event, the 'build', 'clean' and 'distclean'
phases operate within the subdirectory, allowing part of a project to
be (re)built.

The 'install' phase invokes make with a target name of "install". If a
DESTDIR variable is defined, this is passed to make on its commandline.

The 'clean' and 'distclean' phases invoke make with matching target names.
